# English Accent Detection Tool

A Streamlit-based proof-of-concept that detects the English accent spoken in any public `.mp4` video or uploaded file.

This tool extracts audio from video, processes it with a Hugging Face audio classification model, and returns the most likely English accent with a confidence score.

# Features

- Upload or paste any public `.mp4` video
- Audio extracted using `ffmpeg` via `imageio-ffmpeg`
- Runs English accent classification using a fine-tuned lightweight model (for deployment speed)
- Returns:
  - Detected accent
  - Confidence score (0‚Äì100%)
  
  
## Accuracy Note

To keep this demo lightweight and deployable on **Streamlit Cloud‚Äôs free tier**, a **smaller model** was used during deployment.

However, **for best accuracy**,i tested the tool successfully using:

> `ylacombe/accent-classifier` from Hugging Face  
> This model achieved much better classification accuracy in local tests  
> Not used in production due to size and memory limits
